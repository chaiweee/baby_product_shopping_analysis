#### Baby Goods Shopping on Taobao.com Analysis


Ali_Mum_Baby is a dataset that contains more than 9 million children's info (birthday and gender) provided by consumers who share the information in order to receive better recommendations or search results.  
Since the dataset is too big, we can only download the sample dataset provided.  
Typically, this dataset is used to:  
- predict children's ages based on their parents' purchase behavior  
- predict what kind of goods a user would buy based on their children's info (age, gender etc.)  


## My goals:  
Through dataset baby, I can know the birthdates of babies for different user ids. Through dataset trade, I can know the number of trades, date, and the categories bought by different user ids.

- sales: comparing sales for each year, season, month, day
- product categories: which categories are the most popular, which are the least popular
- babies and products: which age range/gender buy which products the most
- repeat buys: the rate of repeat buyers
